# Gfr√∂r.li v2 Firmware

## Timers

We use the following timers:

- `SYST`: Used by RTIC for the scheduling system
- `TIM6`: Used as a `Monotonic` implementation
- `TIM7`: Used as a blocking delay provider for the device drivers


## Build

Requires Rust stable, as specified in the `rust-toolchain` file.

```Bash
# Install dependencies
sudo pacman -S arm-none-eabi-binutils arm-none-eabi-gdb openocd

# Install target
rustup target add thumbv6m-none-eabi

cargo build --release
```


## Run & debug

In one terminal:

    ./openocd.sh

In another terminal:

    cargo run


## Flash

Use `cargo-embed` (0.8+):

    cargo embed flash --release

To reset the target without flashing (requires `cargo-embed` 0.9+):

    cargo embed reset

To enable more verbose debug logging (e.g. with conversion of raw temperature
data) as well as some debug assertions, enable the `dev` features

    cargo embed flash --release --features dev
